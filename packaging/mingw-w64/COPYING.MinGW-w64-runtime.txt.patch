-FIXME: Cephes math lib
+Portions from the Cephes math lib
 Copyright (C) 1984-1998 Stephen L. Moshier
 
-It sounds vague, but as to be found at
-<http://lists.debian.org/debian-legal/2004/12/msg00295.html>, it gives an
-impression that the author could be willing to give an explicit
-permission to distribute those files e.g. under a BSD style license. So
-probably there is no problem here, although it could be good to get a
-permission from the author and then add a license into the Cephes files
-in MinGW runtime. At least on follow-up it is marked that debian sees the
-version a-like BSD one. As MinGW.org (where those cephes parts are coming
-from) distributes them now over 6 years, it should be fine.
+Some of the software included may be from the book _Methods and Programs for
+Mathematical Functions_ (Prentice-Hall, 1989) or from the Cephes Mathematical
+Library, a commercial product. In either event, it is copyrighted by the author.
+It comes with no support or guarantee.
